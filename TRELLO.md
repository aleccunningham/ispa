#An overview of the reccomended workflow for this project using Trello 

- Create cards for each individual case on the TODO list with conscise title and description
- Use a checklist when a case has small steps that must be done in order to finish larger cases
- approproiately add members to cases that they can work on
- Use appropriate Labels to quickly indentify the type of case you are working on (ex. models, issues for fixing code, etc.)
- Once a case is being worked on move related card to IN PROGRESS list
- create branches for most (if not, all) cases to merge into master and attach to revelant case card
- add git commits to relevant case card for small changes on master brahch (v rare)
- once case has been completed and commits or branches attached, move card to REVIEW list so other members can review your code
- if something was off or wrong in your code, leave card in REVIEW list and make appropriate changes
- once all members are satisfied with completed task, only the members who did not work on task can move case from REVIEW to COMPLETED
